# Steel-Surface-Defect-Detection
Steel surface quality inspection is a critical step in manufacturing. So this project focuses on building AI-driven computer vision models to detect, classify, and localize surface defects in steel sheets using the Severstal Steel Defect Detection dataset.it explores multiple modeling approaches—segmentation, classification, and object detection
